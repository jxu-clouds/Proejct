# Hello, everyone, thanks for your interest in my Toy Compiler (Jin's Compiler). Our compiler is built with Python 3.8 and executed under the Linux 2.0 system.

#To implement this toy compiler, we start with  "run.sh" file and a source file for compiling.
bash ./run.sh

#As we run our run.sh file, the program ask for a source file exists in ./ dictionary.; for example :
input.123


#After we type the input file , the compiler will compile our code and covert it into .llv, .out and .o files. These files are stored in ./ dictionary. Then we run ./out to implement this code.

./out
